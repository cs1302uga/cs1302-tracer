# Example 31: java.awt.Color Objects and Transparency

This example demonstrates the heap layout and visualization of `java.awt.Color` objects, including custom RGB values, alpha transparency, and reference aliasing.

## Concepts Illustrated

- **Color Heap Objects**: `java.awt.Color` instances reside on the heap with specialized JSON color representations containing hex strings (`#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`).
- **Transparency Support**: Colors with alpha < 255 include an 8-digit hex string with alpha channel information.
- **Reference Aliasing**: Multiple variable references (`red` and `redAlias`) pointing to the same `Color` heap instance.
- **Color Arrays (`Color[]`)**: Arrays containing references to multiple `Color` objects on the heap.

The tracer emits color data; rendering swatches is the responsibility of a consuming visualizer.
